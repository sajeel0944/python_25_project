Morning sun, shining bright on my way  
Walking alone, in the cold of the night  
Dancing lights, in the heart of the city  
Falling leaves, whisper stories in the wind  
Dreaming big, under stars shining high  
Loving you, feels like magic inside  
Broken hearts, heal with time and space  
Singing loud, to the songs of the past  
Lost in time, memories fade away  
Holding hands, through the storm and the rain  
Midnight blues, echo deep in my soul  
Wandering eyes, searching for a place  
Running fast, chasing dreams untold  
Shadows fall, but the light still remains  
Whispering winds, call my name once again  
Golden skies, painting colors in my mind  
Fading stars, guide me home through the dark  
Raindrops fall, washing sorrows away  
Lonely roads, lead to stories unknown  
Burning fire, keeps me warm in the cold  
Tides will rise, but I’ll never fall  
Calling out, for a love that is true  
Heartbeats race, when I'm close to you  
Gentle waves, kiss the shore every day  
Hope still shines, even through the pain  
Silver moon, lighting up the sky  
Tears may fall, but I’ll still stand tall  
Deep inside, I know I’ll find my way  
Smiling bright, through the darkest night  
Flying high, chasing clouds in the blue  
Colors blend, into a beautiful dream  
Lost and found, in the music of life  
Golden days, remind me of you  
Through the fire, I’ll keep moving on  
Wind will blow, but I’ll never break  
Falling stars, make a wish for me  
Sailing far, to the edge of the sea  
Thunder roars, but I hear your voice  
Painted skies, take my breath away  
Holding on, to the love we had  
Rising sun, brings a brand new day  
Distant dreams, slowly coming true  
Mystic nights, fill my heart with light  
Through the storm, I’ll keep standing strong  
Carried away, by the sound of your song  
Dancing free, like the waves in the sea  
Shining bright, like a diamond in the sky  
Winds may change, but love stays the same
